  <p>I start swimming when I was around 5, just for my hobby. At that moment I really do not practice much. However, I start to take some training course when I was 12. The reason is because I have join the primary school inter-school swimming competition. But I am the last one who finish it. Also as you can figure out that I am really very fat at that time, I want to through swimming to loose some weight. </p>

  <p>Therefore, I had started the regular train, it was really tough. I need to swim more that 3000 meters in one training section, so it make me felt very tired. However, after a few mouth training my waistline decrease from 32 inch to 26 inch. So I feel really shock about that. In this photo you can see How much effort I pay.</p>

    <p>I start to won more price in that few years, but the most memorable one we won a 2nd runner up the 4x50 meter freestyle. Even is just a <span class="metal">metal</span>, we are really excited about this. Since we loose the same even when I was F2 because of my fault, I mix up the time of that event and we miss it. Here is the video below.</p>

    <h3>the frustration and decision</h3>

  <div class="photo"><img src="images/photo/IMG_4920.JPG" alt=""/></div>
  <div class="text">
    <p>However, I stop all the training after that inter-school competition. Because I am really frustrating and loose my passion on swimming. I start feeling this when I was form 3, because I have found out that I did not have a much talent in this aspect. I am not tall enough. My height increase very slow after form 2 and I figure out that I have no chance to be a professional player, therefore why I need to work that hard?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="photo"><img src="images/photo/IMG_5009.JPG"  alt=""/></div>
  <div class="text">
    <p>I never win a match in high level. No matter how much effort I pay I can't be professional. Moreover, I need to care about my academic side too. This make me straggly for almost half year. Finally, I made the decision in that summer, I would too give it up after the inter-school championship in October.</p>
